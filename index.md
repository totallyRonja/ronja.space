Hey there, my name is Ronja BÃ¶hringer and I'm a Tech Art freelancer. So if you need any effects, especially if they need shaders/graphics programming, please hire me.

You can best contact me via email at <a href='mailto:&#099;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#097;&#099;&#116;&#064;&#114;&#111;&#110;&#106;&#097;&#046;&#115;&#112;&#097;&#099;&#101;'>&#099;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#097;&#099;&#116;&#064;&#114;&#111;&#110;&#106;&#097;&#046;&#115;&#112;&#097;&#099;&#101;</a> or via twitter at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/totallyRonja">@totallyRonja</a>.

## Examples of projects I've worked on:

### Good Company:

I worked on Good Company for 10 months while doing my internship as a generalist programmer at Chasing Carrots. My tasks on the game included being part of the design process, implementing many different features(UI, gameplay, backend, graphics programming) on my own and fixing bugs in the Go/C++ backend as well as the Unity frontend. You can find the game here <https://www.goodcompanygame.com/>.

### Elemates:

Elemates was a student project with over 70 people making a game in about 4 months. I was one of the two leaders of the programming team leading the team as well as doing most of the graphics programming. I managed tasks for the 10 people on the team and communicated with the other teams on the project. The finshed game is available at <https://betahsmw.itch.io/elemates>.
