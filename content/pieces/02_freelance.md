In my two years of freelancing I worked on many projects. The biggest ones being a Pacman clone for the car software company Vector, first as a game to entertain clients at trade fairs, then as a online game on their website and a language learning game for norwegian children (distributed, by 
Cappelen Damm, a mayor norwegian book publisher), designed to be embedded into their website and run on school iPad devices.

Smaller jobs included doing some shader work for [curious expedition 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBUVX1hSB3I) (a 2d lighting system) and [NUTS](https://nuts.game) (extension, optimisations and porting help for the existing system).
