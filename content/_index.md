I'm professionally working in the games industry for almost 3 years now, the latest 2 as a freelance (graphics) programmer. I've worked on [good company](https://www.goodcompanygame.com) for about a year and did small things for [curious expedition 2](https://curious-expedition.com/), [NUTS](https://nuts.game/) and made whole games for corporate clients.
While most of my experience is using Unity, I also used multiple other engines and frameworks more briefly and am more than happy to learn.

Right now I'm looking to find a more stable job again, so if you're looking for anything from a gameplay programmer to a tech artist I'd love to talk!
Bonus points if you value diversity and/or make narrative games.
